UDF-Boilerplate
===============

Providing some major AutoIT UDF

We'll try to keep them up-to-date, but it's quite hard, as there is very few AutoIT UDF on GitHub (that we could add as submodules)

This can be useful if you want to get the most important and useful UDF in one `git-checkout`, rather than in multiple downloads everywhere on the web
